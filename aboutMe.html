		<p>My name is Daniel Min and I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
	I was born in Canada, but spent a lot of my childhood in South Korea. Hence, my fluency in both English and Korean.
	During my academic years, I took part in numerous projects. Most of them were done in groups and working in teams granted me the skills to effectively communicate and problem 
	solve under pressure. The projects at school were mostly done in the language of C and C++. However, I learned other languages on
	my own in my spare times. Some of my out-of-school projects include my personal website using html/css and a Java android application
	that I made with a group of people to allow the members of Korean Engineering Students' Association to communicate without
	face-to-face interactions. Although this application is still in its prototype stage, we are planning to improve its functionality
	and completeness in days to come. I'm also currently taking part in developing a real-time emotion detection and music generator application using convolutional neural network and spotipy API. 
	I also have previous experience in front end web developing, where I assisted in managing, maintaining, and updating a church website.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Through my internship experience, I learned a lot about software architecture and design patterns in C++. I also developed and
	optimized numerous algorithms and state machines. Got in touch with image processing techniques and integrating them in C++. Learned to 
			write miscellaneous scripts and develop GUI for internal company convenience and efficiency.</p>
		<br>
			
		
		<p>
	I am also taking part in non-technical extra curricular activities at school. For example, as the Vice President of the Korean
	Engineering Students' Association, I analyze and observe ways to minimize expense and maximize revenue to help the club earn the highest profit possible for events, seminars, etc. I also play a main role in managing members and organizing their roles in the club.
		<br>
	I love getting out and getting active. I've always found joy and fascination in discovering new activities and places. Travelling has been one of my favorite things to do since I was a child. I am always excited to go out there and see new things and meet new people. Some of my other non-technical hobbies and interests include sports, music, and gaming.<br><br><br><br><br>
